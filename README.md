The goal of this repo was to learn how to use matrix operations in machine learning and how to eventually make a basic neural network without using any machine learning libraries.

The files walk through the learning process as I went from clustering a dataset using kmeans all the way to creating a neural network to classify penguins using a test portion of the data, and matching the results to the real section for a 100% success rate.
